# Condo EV Charging in Ontario: The Owner’s Step-by-Step Guide

Yes—condo installs are possible. Board approval is required; we help with paperwork.

Steps:

1) Instant Quote with panel photos and charger location.
2) Virtual Check to confirm feasibility and routing.
3) Condo letter: Generate a board‑ready PDF with owner/unit/spot/building and charger model details.
4) ESA Permit is filed before work begins; Licensed Electrical Contractors perform the install.

For shared garages, run length and trenching may affect pricing. We’ll propose a code‑compliant plan that fits your building’s rules.
