# Workplace & Multi-Unit Charging: Funding Basics

For workplaces and multi‑unit buildings, the path mirrors home installs with added coordination:

- Scope: Quantity, locations, electrical capacity, and access control.
- Funding: Check local, provincial, or federal incentives applicable to business or multi‑unit projects.
- Execution: 1) Instant Quote 2) Virtual Check 3) ESA Permit 4) Install Day.

We route leads to top‑rated partners when capacity or geography requires it—maintaining SLAs for fast acceptance and clear timelines.
