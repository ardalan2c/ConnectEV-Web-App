# Do I Need a Panel Upgrade for an EV Charger in Toronto?

Many homes support 40A charging on existing service. When service is limited or the panel is full, there are options:

- Load management device to safely share capacity.
- Sub‑panel with optimized routing.
- Panel & Service Upgrades when required.

Upload the three panel photos—door open, main breaker, and label—and our Panel Photo Analyzer (AI) will estimate service amps and free slots to guide the recommendation.
